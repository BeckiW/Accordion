# Build a FAQ-site 

Today we're going to learn how to make an accordion, meaning an area that can collapse to show and hide text. These are very often used on FAQ-websites – so let's build one. The FAQ-website should follow this design: 




The Swedish gym chain SATS has a very nice one on their customer service portal, plz see for more inspiration. [Sats Customer Service](https://www.sats.se/kundservice/)

## How to complete this assignment

You FAQ need to fulfill the following requirements: 
1. Expand to show more text on click. 
2. Text that are expanded should collapse back on click. 
3. The icons for plus and minus should be done in CSS. 
4. Every second section should alternate colors, odd ones in one color and even ones in another. 
5. The plus icon should bedome a minus icon when collapsed. 
6. On hover, make the color of the section darker. See the [Sats Example](https://www.sats.se/kundservice/) for inspo. 

Don't care right now about fancy animations for when the text shows – let's leave that for the strech goals.
